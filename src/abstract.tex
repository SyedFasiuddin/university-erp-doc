\section*{ABSTRACT}

The ERP solution proposed here is an application developed for schools and
universitites, developed in Javascript, used to store the information of all the
school related activities. It stores information about students, lecturers,
subjects, and other staff.
The objective here is to reduce the errors that creep up in manual process and
enable the management to have a better system. As an added benefit, this
solution enables the management in saving time that would take in manually
entering and accessing any of the required information about students and
lecturers. By using this solution the required information can be retrived in
seconds, thereby saving time and letting the management focus on more important
tasks.
