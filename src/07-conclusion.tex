\section{CONCLUSION}

With all of the different modules implemented as a server detached from the UI,
we made a system that is scalable just beyond few students, we assume that this
system will be able to handle more than ten thousand students, all of their
details being entered into the system from different sources, such as admin,
faculty etc. The system is robust enough to keep running and do not crash easily
however there will always be room for improvement.

As a future scope for this project, we could say that there could be a better UI
implemented either web based or a native mobile application. Even though this
project covers a lot of everyday aspects of the university, there are a lot of
other situations that we do not keep track of in this project, all of those can
be the future scope of the project.
