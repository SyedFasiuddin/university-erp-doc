\section{SYSTEM ANALYSIS}

System Analysis is a detailed study of the various operations performed by a
system and their relationships within and outside of the system

lot of process of maintaining records of different aspects of a university is
done manually on physical books. This part of management can make use of
digital tools at our disposal and eliminate the need of book keeping.
